                          It is a long established fact that a reader will be
                          distracted by the readable content of a page when
                          looking at its layout. The point of using Lorem Ipsum
                          is that it has a more-or-less normal distribution of
                          letters, as opposed to using 'Content here, content
                          here', making it look like readable English. Many
                          desktop publishing packages and web page editors now
                          use Lorem Ipsum as their default model text, and a
                          search for 'lorem ipsum' will uncover many web sites
                          still in their infancy. Various versions have evolved
                          over the years, sometimes by accident, sometimes on
                          purpose (injected humour and the like).

                          typesetting industry. Lorem Ipsum has been the
                          industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s,
                          when an unknown printer took a galley of type and
                          scrambled it to make a type specimen book. It has
                          survived not only five centuries, but also the leap
                          into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially
                          unchanged. It was popularised in the 1960s with the
                          release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum
                          passages, and more recently with desktop publishing
                          software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of
                          Lorem Ipsum.

                          Contrary to popular belief, Lorem Ipsum is not simply
                          random text. It has roots in a piece of classical
                          Latin literature from 45 BC, making it over 2000 years
                          old. Richard McClintock, a Latin professor at
                          Hampden-Sydney College in Virginia, looked up one of
                          the more obscure Latin words, consectetur, from a
                          Lorem Ipsum passage, and going through the cites of
                          the word in classical literature, discovered the
                          undoubtable source. Lorem Ipsum comes from sections
                          1.10.32 and 1.10.33 of "de Finibus Bonorum et Malorum"
                          (The Extremes of Good and Evil) by Cicero, written in
                          45 BC. This book is a treatise on the theory of
                          ethics, very popular during the Renaissance. The first
                          line of Lorem Ipsum, "Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet..",
                          comes from a line in section 1.10.32.

                          Pbench is a short of "Performance bench", is a
                          comprehensive framework that assist engineers with
                          their benchmarking and performance analysis.
                        <br>
                        
                          The framework in short strives to make the life of
                          performance engineer more efficient and comprehensive.
                          The most products mowadays are distributed systems and
                          our team members run the same or similar benchmarks
                          with their own wrappers in order to gather data. This
                          process lead to incomplete or inconsistent data
                          collection depending on who ran it. We found it
                          difficult to compare data sets, or found incomplete
                          data depending on who ran what. So, we worked to come
                          up with a framework that captured the best practices
                          across the team.
                        </p>

                          <ul><li> Collect data from one or more than one systems
                          <br />
                          <li> Indexes and verifies it <br />

                        <h3>Motivation</h3>
                        <p class="mb-30"style="color: black;">
                          The thought to improve our ability to collect and
                          visualize performance analysis data and automate our
                          workloads. The key was creating a tool which would be
                          convenient, user-friendly, and powerful. In
                          performance work, you may need to use quite a lot of
                          tools to understand the problem, as well as run
                          workloads with many permutations. Pbench sought to
                          make this much more accessible by providing common
                          commands to use these tools and benchmarks. Once the
                          user knew a couple of simple commands for pbench, they
                          could run dozens of tools and workloads.
                        </p>

                        <h5>
                          With this background, the pbench framework is being
                          developed with the following goals in mind:

                          tools on Linux systems <li>Standardize the

                        Agent acts as a collection spot of data. It collects the
                        data and send to server with the help of
                        `pbench-move-results` command. Server acts as a
                        collector of data. It helps to verify the tarballs by
                        checking whether the data that is collected is valid and
                        error free. It then indexes the data and send to
                        elasticsearch. Elasticsearch mapped data is then fetched
                        by the Dashboard and Kibana for Visualization where we
                        can compare or visualize our data with the help of
                        tables or graphs easily.
