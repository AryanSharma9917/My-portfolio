                          It is a long established fact that a reader will be
                          distracted by the readable content of a page when
                          looking at its layout. The point of using Lorem Ipsum
                          is that it has a more-or-less normal distribution of
                          letters, as opposed to using 'Content here, content
                          here', making it look like readable English. Many
                          desktop publishing packages and web page editors now
                          use Lorem Ipsum as their default model text, and a
                          search for 'lorem ipsum' will uncover many web sites
                          still in their infancy. Various versions have evolved
                          over the years, sometimes by accident, sometimes on
                          purpose (injected humour and the like).

                          Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and
                          typesetting industry. Lorem Ipsum has been the
                          industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s,
                          when an unknown printer took a galley of type and
                          scrambled it to make a type specimen book. It has
                          survived not only five centuries, but also the leap
                          into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially
                          unchanged. It was popularised in the 1960s with the
                          release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum
                          passages, and more recently with desktop publishing
                          software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of
                          Lorem Ipsum.

                          Contrary to popular belief, Lorem Ipsum is not simply
                          random text. It has roots in a piece of classical
                          Latin literature from 45 BC, making it over 2000 years
                          old. Richard McClintock, a Latin professor at
                          Hampden-Sydney College in Virginia, looked up one of
                          the more obscure Latin words, consectetur, from a
                          Lorem Ipsum passage, and going through the cites of
                          the word in classical literature, discovered the
                          undoubtable source. Lorem Ipsum comes from sections
                          1.10.32 and 1.10.33 of "de Finibus Bonorum et Malorum"
                          (The Extremes of Good and Evil) by Cicero, written in
                          45 BC. This book is a treatise on the theory of
                          ethics, very popular during the Renaissance. The first
                          line of Lorem Ipsum, "Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet..",
                          comes from a line in section 1.10.32.

                        <p class="mb-30" style="color: black;">Hello world,</p>
                        

                        <p class="mb-30"style="color: black;">We have many things to motivate us but from where does motivation starts? What motivates us? This is a question that everybody asks oneself or another person. We always look at another person and think yes he/she can be my motivation or a video or anything else. Isn't the motivation to start from ourselves? Motivation to keep ourselves motivated.

<br><i>The willingness to do something starts from our end first then it reaches the other.</i>
         

<br><h3>Desires</h3>
<p class="mb-30"style="color: black;">We all have wishes. There can be any kind of wish innocent, weird, sweet, truthful, and a lot more. There are countless desires that a person would love to fulfill. Like, to help others, to make your expenses, or not to depend on anyone else. Each person has a desire or something that they are not able to do at present but would love to fulfill one day. After all, we are all searching for meanings in our lives and these desires give us meaning. The things we love, things we want, things we want to spend our time on, people we love, making others happy it can be anything.

<br><h3>Plans</h3>
<p class="mb-30"style="color: black;">Plans are stepping stones for our dreams. As we have chapters in a book to cover the whole story, we have plans. Accomplishing these small wins is what keeps us going on. These small plans are like small goals that lead us to a bigger goal. It is once said -
<br><i>"Plans are what leads us to a Journey, After all, it is a journey that is much more beautiful than destination".</i></br>
Plans make us keep believing in ourselves. Taking small steps towards our Dreams and fulfill them is what encourages us, to plan more plans and work towards them. Traveling to a small place is a small step towards a world tour. Reading the first page of a book leads you to go on a new adventure. Adventures are what keeps our souls alive. We live for these small moments that become part of a lifetime.

<br><h3>Small Treats</h3>
<p class="mb-30"style="color: black;"><i>"Make Big changes by taking little steps"</i></br>
I went through a talk by Marty Lobdell. He said, <i>"Treating oneself for small accomplishments leads you to greater achievements".</i> Always treat yourself with small accomplishments like, a break after a plan completion, a song after a chapter, chocolate after practice, or anything that you love. This keeps you going on working on your goals without losing interest in them. After all, it's all about happiness either a single short or many numbers of shorts.</br>
                      
<h3>Dreams</h3>
<p class="mb-30"style="color: black;">Always follow your heart that's where all the Dreams lie. We are the best versions of ourselves if we follow what we want. Dreams are what keep us going on when we are awake. They help us to make choices in our endeavors. We make decisions in our life keeping our goals in mind and this is what helps us take a risk. Many obstacles or diversions may occur but after all, it is once said-

  <i><br>Two roads diverged in a wood,
and I— I took the one less traveled by,
And that has made all the difference.
- The Road Not Taken by Robert Frost</br></i>

Dreams are what keeps us alive. Always fetch your chance and work for it. Dreams never let us leave what we are pursuing, keeps us believing in what we want, and pursue them.


<i><br><br>"We are such stuff as dreams are made on" - William Shakespeare</br></br></i>

Keep following your dreams and be Happy :)
