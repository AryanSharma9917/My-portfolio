                          It is a long established fact that a reader will be
                          distracted by the readable content of a page when
                          looking at its layout. The point of using Lorem Ipsum
                          is that it has a more-or-less normal distribution of
                          letters, as opposed to using 'Content here, content
                          here', making it look like readable English. Many
                          desktop publishing packages and web page editors now
                          use Lorem Ipsum as their default model text, and a
                          search for 'lorem ipsum' will uncover many web sites
                          still in their infancy. Various versions have evolved
                          over the years, sometimes by accident, sometimes on
                          purpose (injected humour and the like).

                          Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and
                          typesetting industry. Lorem Ipsum has been the
                          industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s,
                          when an unknown printer took a galley of type and
                          scrambled it to make a type specimen book. It has
                          survived not only five centuries, but also the leap
                          into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially
                          unchanged. It was popularised in the 1960s with the
                          release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum
                          passages, and more recently with desktop publishing
                          software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of
                          Lorem Ipsum.

                          Contrary to popular belief, Lorem Ipsum is not simply
                          random text. It has roots in a piece of classical
                          Latin literature from 45 BC, making it over 2000 years
                          old. Richard McClintock, a Latin professor at
                          Hampden-Sydney College in Virginia, looked up one of
                          the more obscure Latin words, consectetur, from a
                          Lorem Ipsum passage, and going through the cites of
                          the word in classical literature, discovered the
                          undoubtable source. Lorem Ipsum comes from sections
                          1.10.32 and 1.10.33 of "de Finibus Bonorum et Malorum"
                          (The Extremes of Good and Evil) by Cicero, written in
                          45 BC. This book is a treatise on the theory of
                          ethics, very popular during the Renaissance. The first
                          line of Lorem Ipsum, "Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet..",
                          comes from a line in section 1.10.32.

                        <p class="mb-30"style="color: black;">Hello world,</p>
                        <p class="mb-30"style="color: black;">
                            This is my first Blog and I wanted to share my experience as an Open Source Contibutor.</br></br>

                            When we start contibuting to Open Source we feel a lot overwhelmed. There are millions of projects on GitHub and we have to choose one of them. Github becomes our major concern and everything around it a Mystery :D. We go through various repositries but unable to finalise in which to contribute and when we finally understand then it is always about HOW. GitHub is all about HOW. How to do this , How to do that, How to push a PR, How to Clone a repo, Blah! Blah! Blah! but being true once you know the answer of this HOW you know about most of the possiblities.</br></br>
                            
                            The best thing about GitHub is we get an unlimited amount of knowledge, explore anything and learn from each other. I started GitHub with my own Project. That was the experience which led me to never stop being a part of this. The easiness that it offer is priceless. Then, I moved to contributing into other projects and realised it's real value. It is always more important to gain knowledge and contributing to projects gives us that. We get to learn about the aproaches that can be used, the ideas behind a project, structure which can be helpful, new technologies, new languages and a lot more, It gives you a wide and unlimited access to knowledge base.
                            
                        <br><h3>The Challenge</h3></br></br>
                            GSoC is known by everyone, if you are an open Source Contributor than you know about GSoC. Everyone is hell crazy about that even I was too :D</br></br>
                            
                            I tried in GSOC for two consecutive years. The experience that we gain from GSOC is really priceless. If we keep on being pessimist like it won't happen, I should not do this, blah! blah! blah! all these are myths believe me trying a little thing with a lot of hard work and keeping in mind that I will get to learn something new is the thing that is priceless. That little smile after accomplishing the task that you thought is impossible is what brings happiness and confidence to face those challenges more and more.</br></br>
                            
                            The very First time when I tried for GSoc I was completely unknown to it. I had contributed on Github but the hype of GSoC is what sometimes makes you a little extra nervous. I didn't submit my proposal as there was nothing I was aiming for and being true I wasn't prepared. I just kept on exploring the repositories in which I can contribute and the time just got over. That's how my first attempt ended. That was kind of foolish but yaa that prepared me for another year of attempt at GSoC.</br></br>
                            
                            In my Second attempt I was prepared beforehand. I had gone through repositories, I had selected my project in which I have to contribute, that was Nuitka. It was a special project for me. I liked it, it aligned with my skills and found it comfortable to work on. I worked on it, made contribution, its just due to some miss communication everything fall to the wrong side. I know my second attempt ended at wrong page but the knowledge I gained with this experience is really exceptional. I got to learn a new language, jinja, learned a lot from my mentor, he is really good and an awesome mentor.</br></br>
                            
                            Failure always stinks but we should never forget the experience we gain from it and trust me there are many potholes :D, so better we learn to jump :)!</br></br>
                            
                            Open Source always welcomes you with wide open repos :D. We always have some Good and some bad experiences. Sometimes you want to contribute to a repo but unable to understand it's structure, or the way it is working, you like the idea but it didn't align with your skills at all but that is the challenge and that is where you can widen your knowledge and learn about more stuff. So, Keep Learning and most importantly Be Happy :)
